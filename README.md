# sustainabilitygame
These are the files of my simple project (sustainability-game)
for the promotion of sustainability across the world. this
simple and (not really easy) game developed by kevin, and the website
itself developed by me aaron. This website didnt take the longest to develop but
i do like to think i did a good job and same with kevin. I do have to give 
credit to conor for helping with the design and overall helped with improvement
of the finished product. You can find a much less detailed version in the credits 
scection of the website. 
We do wish to improve on this and make even better and more complicated games.

I did use multiple tools to make this project easier which i will list here:
scratch htmlifier: https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/
scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/
netlify hosting: https://nelify.com/
notepad++: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

Thanks for reading!
